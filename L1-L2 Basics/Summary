1. Computation graph:
    1. assembel a graph
    2. use a session to execute operations in the graph

2. Tensorborad for visualization

3. tf.constant and tf.Variable
    Constant values are stored in the graph definition
    Sessions allocate memory to store variable values

4. tf.placeholders and feed_dict
    Feed values into placeholders by dic(feed_dict)
    You can feed values in variables too

5. Avoid lazy loading
    1. Separate the assembling of graph and executing ops
    2. Use python attribute to ensure a function is only loaded the first time it's called
